# Unprioritised
- Figure out using environments with shared Tweet lib

- Nicer translation mouse-overs
- Factor out translation
- Move img/tweet url construction into domain model
- Factor out getting follower counts
- Make follower count differences visually more prominent
- I want to see which links have reached the most followers
- I want to see which links have had the most retweets
- For any link, I want to see what people have said about it
- Factor out link lookup
- Factor out filtering
- I want to filter spammy tweets directly from the interface
- Pagination & fade out read messages, not hide completely

# Someday, maybe
