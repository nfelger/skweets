# SYNOPSIS

¡OMG it's a twitter thing!

It pulls tweets mentioning Songkick (no, that's not configurable – why would you want to change that?) from THE INTERNET and graciously translates Foreign to English. Like magic. And it even, guess what? I mean… I can't even words. YES:COLOR! In your bash! You can close your mouth now, I'm impressed too.

What do you mean, "tests"?

_UPDATE_ As a super added benefit for my trusty users (that's myself, yes), it doesn't do any of the above anymore.
